# WeatherStationApp using Events to demonstrate Observer Pattern

This project is based on my original project in which I use basic interface concepts to demonstrate observer pattern.

This project is about using Events feature in C# to simplify the steps of creating and implementing interfaces used in the pattern, and still maintain the "loosely coupled" design principals.
